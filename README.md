## Status

Duskers is well suited for Talon Voice since most of the game's interaction is controlled by short-cut keys and console commands.  The menus and console commands are now available as voice commands through Talon Voice.

Mouse controls are not covered by this repository at this time.  Most of the game can be played without needing to use the mouse.  However occasional mouse usage is sometimes needed to percisely position the in-game drones.  Its assumed the user already has other solutions for controlling the mouse.  Some suggestions are:
  * Talon Voice's built-in Eye Tracking - requires additional hardware
  * [Screen Spots](https://github.com/AndrewDant/screen-spots) - saves and restores places on screen to move or click the mouse.
  * [Dense Mouse Grid](https://github.com/tararoys/dense-mouse-grid) - grid overlay for controlling the mouse with alphabet coordinate names.
  * [Racer Mouse](https://gist.github.com/timo/d3a8c871aca93aee4cd8b4fc57b15187) - an experiment to 'drive' the mouse using noises.  may be fun to drive the in-game drones this way.
